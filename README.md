# PrimeVue InputNumber debug app

[Vite](https://vite.dev/)/[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) app for understanding the order and contents of events emitted by
[PrimeVue's](https://primevue.org/) [`InputNumber`](https://primevue.org/inputnumber) component.

## Install

```shell
npm install
```

## Run

```shell
npm run dev
```

## Use

* Locate the input field
* Change its contents
* Observe what values are emitted by viewing the page and console log.
* Figure out what the hell the purpose of `formattedValue` is (and please let me know if you do!).
* Delete this project and forget that it ever existed.
